# 第一次作业

## 1、什么是中间件？英文回答，你使用过哪些中间件技术在练习或工程项目中？

Middleware is an independent system software or service program. Distributed application software uses this software to share resources between different technologies. Middleware is located on the operating system of client / server, which manages computer resources and network communication. Separate applications or two separate systems. Connected systems, even if they have different interfaces, can still exchange information with each other through middleware.


Middleware is between the operating system and application software, which provides service functions for application software, including message middleware, transaction middleware, application server, etc. Because it is between the two kinds of software, it is called middleware.


只用过node的server,body-parser,mysql模块等，但感觉在node中应该叫包(package)

##2. 看文献 An Energy-Aware Middleware Platform for Dynamic Applications


## 3、 论中间件技术在应用软件开发中的作用。

因为我前端比较熟，所以作用就从node层面讲了，它给我的感觉就像是一些功能封装起来而已，这个在node中应该也可以叫包(package)。

然后封装的好处，一是减少代码冗余，二是使代码更简洁、易读，三减少回调(node中特有的)
